# IOT_Message_Board

This is a modified version of the demo code found in the MD_MAX72XX Library.
I have added functions to allow a number of preset messages to be
included and the use of a button on D2 to enable the cycling round
of the preset messages and the received web message.

Hardware used NODEMCU AMICA, MAX7219 LED MATRIX Display, A button
